# Compiler Project

## ðŸ“‚ Description  
This project is dedicated to creating a compiler for a custom programming language. The compiler is capable of recognizing multiple basic data types such as `int`, `float`, `char`, `string`, `bool`, as well as array types and user-defined data types (similar to classes). Additionally, it can interpret mathematical expressions involving both variables and constants, executing the required calculations.

The program written in this language follows a specific structure divided into four key sections:
1. **Global Variables** â€“ Declare and initialize global variables.
2. **Functions** â€“ Define functions that perform operations.
3. **User-Defined Data Types** â€“ Create custom types, resembling classes.
4. **Entry Point Function** â€“ The special function that starts program execution.

The compiler performs **semantic analysis** and provides detailed error messages for both syntax and semantic errors. If any issues are found, the program will not be executed.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:
- **C** â€“ For programming the compiler.
- **Lex** â€“ For lexical analysis (tokenizing input).
- **Yacc** â€“ For syntax analysis (parsing the language).

## ðŸš€ How to Run:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone hhttps://github.com/UngureanuAnaMaria/Compiler.git
2. **Build the Project:**
    ```bash
   make
